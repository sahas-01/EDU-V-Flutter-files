# EDU-V
### The Future of Education online


## Problem at hand

The present situation is very uncertain for every single one of us. We are stuck at our homes for over a year now and online learning is starting to become more of a problem now. 
Let us understand this with a case study. For example, a student cannot really perform any laboratory experiment, due to lack of resources and lack of appropriate mentorship. Added to this, the student would have to perform the experiment individually, which further adds to the already existent monotonous e-learning routine. This problem can be extended to other fields such as music or dance, wherein the individual does is unable to acquire the right equipment to perform and is also unable to connect with the right set of tutors for the same. 

## Abstract

EDU-V is an online platform for learners to connect with trainers from various fields. It is a platform to learn and perform experiments and to learn new skills or honing already existing ones. It helps people living in remote areas to connect with educators and fellow peers from all around the world. There is also a feature of Virtual Labs on offer which would enable students to perform experiments like they would do physically in a lab at the comfort of their homes(using Augmented Reality). Since we are living in an unprecedented situation, this platform would not only make learning easier, but would also give students a classroom like experience. For example,if a student wants to perform a physics experiment, he/she would choose the subject, followed by the experiment that he/she would like to perform, following which the user will be redirected to a tab wherein he would be asked to choose to perform the experiment individually, or whether he would like to collaborate with a friend and perform the same.This way it does not become monotonous for a student who is at home all alone staring at a laptop screen.

## What makes EDU-V stand out 

At present, we face stiff competition from various E-learning platforms like BYJUâ€™s, Unacademy, Skillshare etc. These platforms provide a variety of courses to the student. These platforms provide courses for students created by various educators(free/paid). However, there are some aspects that these platforms have failed to cover. There is no provision for renting of equipment. Secondly, the already existent platforms cater to only academics. Apart from that, there is no possibility for the student to actually perform an experiment. 


## Advantages

What sets EDU-V apart from all these platforms is that,for most courses, the control of what is being taught is entirely upto the student and the teacher. EDU-V will be a platform that will not only provide predefined courses but will also connect you to some of the best educators out there. There shall be provision of renting professional equipment. Not just that, our platform also offers AR integrated labs which will only enhance the process of performing the experiment. Provision for real time collaboration is also possible on the portal.

## Future Prospects

- VR integration for immersive learning.
- More number of courses.
- Courses and learning for larger number of fields.
